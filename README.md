# Admin panel for crm100

## Brief

This project is designed with `Laravel` as backend, `React.js` as frontend and `MySql` for storing data.

## Installation

There are two main directories in the root: `project` and `public_html`.

All logics and Laravel core files are in `project` directory. `public_html` is responsible for representing the website, and all asset files such as images, js files and css are in it.

I created two files in the `project` directory which specify the environment and paths to main directories:
`server-config.json`, `server-config.php`. If you deploy the project on a subdomain, you can simply change the public_path in both files and we are all set.

### server-config.json

```bash
{
    "relativePublicPath": "./../public_html",
    "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
}
```

### server-config.php

```bash
define('BASE_URL', 'http://127.0.0.1:8000');
define('PUBLIC_PATH', __DIR__ . '/../public_html');
define('FRAMEWORK_PATH', __DIR__);
```

### Database configuration

Also, you have to set the database connection parameters in `.env`:

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=non_certificates_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=123456
```

### Tables migrations and fake data initialization

Go to the `project` directory and run this custom command:

```bash
php artisan project:init
```

This command creates a user to login:

````bash
user: 09155295009
password: 123456789a

## Deployment

To start the project on the server, just open your website:

```bash
  GET /
```

Or go to the `project` directory and run `artisan serve` command on localhost:

```bash
  php artisan serve
```

As mentioned before, default credentials are:

**username:** 09155295009

**password:** 123456789a

### Initialization

If you're on localhost, you can simply run a custom artisan console command to initialize the project:

```bash
php artisan project:init
```

If everything goes well, the output will be like this:

```bash

## Documentation

### Architecture

As Laravel is based on MVC, I use another layer called `Service`, which is responsible for all logic operations, so `Controller` layer is just for receiving inputs and representing outputs.

I also use separate classes for validating requests and send them as request inputs to controllers. These classes throw exceptions on invalid input fields, and in `render` function in `Handler` class, it will be catched and based on error, shows the appropriate response.

The project uses `API Resources` as `Repositories` to standardize responses.
It also utilizes Laravel ORM, `Eloquent`, for readability and integration.

#### Database

The project uses `MySQL` which is an open-source relational database management system.

#### sanctum

As API calls are stateless, sessions can't be used to identify users.
I use `sanctum` to authenticate and authorize users.
On the backend, I use `middlewares` to handle users accessing endpoint routes.

#### Application state container

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state. Redux is used for notifications, the current user properties, the current page the user is in, and so on.

#### UI

The project utilizes [coreui](https://coreui.io/) which is a free Bootstrap Admin Dashboard Template, and I made some changes to it.

For frontend validation, the project uses Yup which is a schema builder for runtime value parsing and validation.
